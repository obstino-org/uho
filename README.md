Optionally modify model paths inside "whisper.h".  
Default model path is defined inside Whisper class, using std::string path = ".\\";  
Default model path is therefore in same directory as exe file.  
  
Obtain CTranslate2 models using notebook from "use_models/fetch_and_convert_models.ipynb"  
CTranslate2 models by default are fetched and converted into "ct2_base_artur_best" folder.  
From this folder, copy all files into same directory as exe file.  
  
Make sure to read README's.
